      <h2> Biography </h2>
      <p></br>
      I stumbled upon web development in Febuary, 2017
      and haven't looked back since. As fun as it has been these last few years,
      I'm hoping to keep doing this for a long time henceforth.
      </br>Here’s a timeline of how I ended up here. Feel free to read it as if Morgan
      Freeman was narrating it.</p> </> <h2> Timeline </h2>
 <p class="timeline"><strong>1994</strong> - Brandon is born in Huddinge Sjukhus
   , Stockholm. Time has yet to tell if this was something good for the
   world or not.<br>
 </br> <strong>2000</strong> - Having now started school, he is offered to skip two grades because of early ability to read and his affinity for math, being able to do simple multiplication. His mother declines the offer, (rightfully) wanting her son to develop social skills at his own pace, with kids the same age. Also, she knows her son is a crybaby and would probably get bullied.</br></br>
 <strong>2004</strong> - At 10 years old, being at his intellectual peak and studying more advanced math than his 13-year old brother, he is banned from bringing his math books home during school holidays, because, and I quote “ He sits with them at the dinner table, and he’s stopped playing with his brother”. This played a factor in his passion for math dying, as he cruised through all of the remaining five years of grade school without studying any more math.  “Damn you, mom.” Brandon thought. “I was so close to becoming a Nobel Prize-winning genius“<br> (Narrator's note: He really wasn’t. At all.)</br></br>
 <strong>2010 </strong> - Brandon graduates elementary school, earning the highest grade in all but four subjects. His older brother Alexander, who managed to get a perfect score on all of them, never let him hear the end of it.</br></br>
 <strong>2013 </strong> - Brandon celebrates graduating high school with his family and friends, although unbeknownst to most of the people attending his party, he got a failing grade in 11 subjects. He's offered a full-time job as a “fritidspedagog” (leisure-time pedagogue) at a school he’s helped out during high school, by helping with grading tests and assisting students with homework. Here, Brandon is exposed to the working environment for the first-time, quickly adjusting while learning the ropes of being a working adult.
 <strong> 2015 </strong> -
